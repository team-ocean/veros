Veropt
--------------------

.. warning::

   The following package is not yet compatible with Veros v1.x.x. The last compatible version is `v0.2.3 <https://veros.readthedocs.io/en/v0.2.3/>`_.

`Veropt <https://github.com/idax4325/veropt>`_ (Bayesian Optimisation for the Versatile Ocean Simulator) is a Python package that aims to make Bayesian Optimisation easy to approach, inspect and adjust. It was developed for `Veros <https://veros.readthedocs.io/en/v0.2.3/>`_ with the aim of providing a user-friendly optimisation tool to tune ocean simulations to real world data. Veropt can be used with any optimisation problem but has been developed for expensive optimisation problems with a small amount of evaluations (~100) and the default set-up will probably be most relevant in such a context.

For more information about the package and the methods implemented in it, take a look at `veropt GitHub <https://github.com/idax4325/veropt>`_ repository and `Ida Stoustrup's thesis <https://nbi.ku.dk/english/theses/masters-theses/ida_lei_stoustrup/Ida_Stoustrup_MSc_Thesis.pdf>`_.
