Benchmarks
==========

.. warning::

   The following benchmarks are for general orientation only. Benchmark results are highly platform dependent; your mileage may vary.


Varying problem size
--------------------

This benchmark varies the size of the computational domain and records the runtime per iteration. It is executed on a single machine with 24 CPU cores and an NVidia Tesla P100 GPU.

We run the same model code with all Veros backends (``numpy``, ``numpy-mpi``, ``jax``, ``jax-mpi``, ``jax-gpu``) and PyOM2 (``fortran``, ``fortran-mpi``).

As a rule of thumb, we find that JAX is about as fast as Fortran on CPU, with NumPy being about 4x slower. GPUs are a competitive alternative to CPUs, as long as the problems fit into GPU memory.


Varying number of MPI processes
-------------------------------

In this benchmark, Veros and PyOM2 run for a fixed problem size, but varying number of processes. This allows us to check how both libraries scale with increased CPU count. The problem size corresponds to :doc:`1 degree global resolution </reference/setups/1deg>`.

It is executed on the `DC³ <https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/research/pice/dc3/>`__ cluster (Danish Center for Climate Computing). Each cluster nodes contains 16 CPUs.

We see that both Veros and PyOM2 scale well with increasing number of processes, even for this moderate problem size. JAX performance is comparable to Fortran.
